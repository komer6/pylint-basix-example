About FastAPI:
--------------
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
It uses Python type hints for validation, auto-generates documentation (Swagger), and is built on Starlette and Pydantic.


About Pylint:
-------------
Pylint is a static code analysis tool that checks your Python code for errors, enforces a coding standard, and gives you a score out of 10.
It helps you write cleaner and more maintainable code by pointing out issues like unused imports, naming conventions, and missing docstrings.
